#### 🍎 **macOS Security Notice**
**IMPORTANT**: macOS will block this app because it's not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. **The app is completely safe** - this is just Apple's security measure for free/open-source software.

**🚨 If you see "damaged" or "cannot verify developer" errors:**

**Quick Fix (30 seconds):**
1. **Open Terminal** (⌘ + Space, type "Terminal")
2. **Copy and paste this command:**
   ```bash
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/Markdown*.dmg
   ```
3. **Press Enter** and try opening the .dmg again

**Alternative Methods:**
- **Right-click** the .dmg → **"Open"** → **"Open"** (bypass Gatekeeper)
- **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **"Open Anyway"**

**Why this happens:** Apple charges $99/year for code signing certificates. Since this is free open-source software, we don't pay for Apple's "blessing" - but the app is just as safe!

1. **Create a New Document**: Click the "+" tab or use Ctrl+N (Cmd+N on Mac)
2. **Start Writing**: Begin typing your markdown content in the editor
3. **Preview Your Work**: Use the split view to see your formatted content live
4. **Save Your Document**: Use Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac) or enable auto-save
